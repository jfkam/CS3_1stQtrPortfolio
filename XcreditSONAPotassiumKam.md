    <h1> Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting </h1>
    <h2> ''' 1. One of the key points mentioned during the SONA 2025 that I found interesting was the part where President Marcos promised to pay off the hospital bills for patients fighting against diseases. I found this really significant and helpful for the side of the patients since a huge weight has been lifted off them. They do not need to worry about the bills; instead they would only focused on recovering. </h2>
    <h2> ''' 2. Another thing I was intrigued in was when President Marcos brought up the 20 pesos per kilo of rice. Although the proposal was already planned before the SONA,  the action has yet to be put in placed. Therfore, it sounded reasurring when he announced that the 20 pesos per kilo has already started around the Philippines.
