   ### Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting 

  #### 1. One of the key points mentioned during the SONA 2025 that I found interesting was the part where President Marcos promised to pay off the hospital bills for patients fighting against diseases. I found this really significant and helpful for the side of the patients since a huge weight has been lifted off them. They do not need to worry about the bills; instead they would only focused on recovering.

  #### 2. Another thing I was intrigued in was when President Marcos brought up the 20 pesos per kilo of rice program. Although the proposal was already planned before the SONA,  the action has yet to be put in placed. Therfore, it sounded reasurring when he announced that the 20 pesos per kilo has already started around the Philippines. 

  ### Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason

  #### 1.One of the things I found weird that President Marcos mentioned was about the investigation of a certain group of higher officials who stole public funds to fill their own pockets and use it for their personal desires. I wondered if the investigation will be done honestly or will be deceived.

  ### Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

   #### SONA 2025 was a timely speech by President Marcos with emphasis on what his administration had done and plans to do ahead to improve the condition of the country . It also brought awareness, answers and solutions to the outstanding problems faced by the country. Whether or not they’ll achieve their goals, their actions will definitely impact the future of the nation. 

  #### The key points discussed by the President were straightforward, significant, and clear without any unnecessary information. As discussed, the main points that stood out to me were on the education sector, flood control, investigations, P20 pesos per kilo of rice program, extensions of healthcare and additional sports events. As pleasing as they sound, I do hope they are not purely “talks” but will eventually be put into action that will benefit the Filipinos. If all these promises and plans of the president are accomplished, these could lead to more meaningful and improved lives of the Filipinos and the entire nation will progress.

  ### What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

  #### I hope the best for the Philippines.
