    Greetings to the reader! I am Julia F. Kam, or simply Julia. 
    <br><br>
    I am currently a grade 9 student of 9 - Potassium. I look forward to this school year to be filled with unforgettable memories, not the ones that give me nightmares!
    <br><br>
    I love designing my works and making them as aesthetically pleasing as possible. I tend to over design at times but if required I try to keep things as simple as possible. 
    <br><br>
    Anyways, that's it for my short introudction folks! See you next time.
    <br><br>
